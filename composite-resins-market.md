<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite resins are versatile materials used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and construction. They are commonly classified into two types based on their curing mechanisms: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic composite resins can be melted and reshaped multiple times, making them ideal for applications requiring flexibility. On the other hand, thermosetting composite resins undergo a chemical reaction during curing, becoming solid and inflexible. Both types offer unique properties and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the end-use application.</p></p>
