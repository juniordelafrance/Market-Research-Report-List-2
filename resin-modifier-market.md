<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resin Modifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>by Function</li><li>Mono-functional Modifiers</li><li>Poly-functional Modifiers</li><li>by Product Type</li><li>Non-reactive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resin Modifiers are classified based on their function and product type. Mono-functional modifiers serve a single purpose, while poly-functional modifiers offer multiple benefits. Non-reactive modifiers do not chemically interact with the resin, enhancing its properties solely through physical means. In contrast, reactive modifiers chemically bond with the resin, altering its structure and properties. These classifications help in understanding the diverse applications and impacts of resin modifiers in the market.</p></p>
