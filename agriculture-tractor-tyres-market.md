<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tractor Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural tractor tires can be classified into two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires are designed with steel belts running at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, offering improved traction and reduced soil compaction. On the other hand, bias (crossply) agriculture tires have bias ply construction with crisscrossing layers of nylon or polyester cords, providing a cost-effective option for agricultural machinery. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different farming applications.</p></p>
