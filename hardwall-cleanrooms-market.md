<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hardwall Cleanrooms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Cleanroom</li><li>Negative Pressure Cleanroom</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hardwall cleanrooms can be categorized into two main types based on the airflow direction within the controlled environment: positive pressure cleanrooms and negative pressure cleanrooms. In positive pressure cleanrooms, the air pressure inside is kept higher than that outside, preventing outside contaminants from entering. This type is typically used in industries where protection against contamination is crucial. On the other hand, negative pressure cleanrooms have lower air pressure inside compared to outside, ensuring that any contaminants generated within are contained.</p></p>
