<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Polymers</li><li>Thermosetting Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic polymer market is divided into two main types: thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting polymers. Thermoplastic polymers can be melted and reshaped multiple times without affecting their properties, making them ideal for recycling. They are used in a wide range of applications such as packaging, automotive, and construction. On the other hand, thermosetting polymers undergo a chemical reaction during curing which makes them heat-resistant and rigid. These polymers are commonly used in electrical insulators, composites, and coatings.</p></p>
