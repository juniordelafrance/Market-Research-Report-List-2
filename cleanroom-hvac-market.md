<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cleanroom HVAC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Decentralized</li><li>Centralized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cleanroom HVAC systems can be categorized into two main types: decentralized and centralized systems. Decentralized systems involve individual HVAC units placed within or near the cleanroom space, providing local control and flexibility. On the other hand, centralized systems involve a single HVAC unit that serves the entire cleanroom facility, offering cost efficiency and centralized control. Both types have their own advantages and drawbacks, with decentralized systems being more suitable for smaller spaces and centralized systems being more effective for larger facilities.</p></p>
