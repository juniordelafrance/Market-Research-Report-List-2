<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Level Gauges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnetic Level Gauges are available in two types - Contact and Non-Contact. Contact magnetic level gauges use floats or displacers that come into direct contact with the liquid being measured, providing accurate readings. On the other hand, Non-Contact magnetic level gauges use magnetic fields to detect the liquid level without actually touching the liquid, making it suitable for hazardous or corrosive environments. Both types have their own unique advantages and are used in various industries based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
