<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cheese Coagulation Detection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cheese coagulation detection systems utilize contact or non-contact methods for detecting the coagulation process in cheese making. Contact systems involve direct physical contact with the cheese curd to measure parameters such as firmness and viscosity. Non-contact systems, on the other hand, use technologies like ultrasound or infrared sensors to detect changes in the cheese without physically touching it. Both types of systems play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and consistency of cheese production.</p></p>
