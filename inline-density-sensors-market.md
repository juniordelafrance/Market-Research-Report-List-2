<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inline Density Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inline density sensors are used in various industries to measure the density of liquids and slurries. Contact type sensors directly come in contact with the substance being measured, providing accurate readings but requiring regular maintenance. Non-contact type sensors, on the other hand, use methods such as gamma-ray absorption or ultrasonic technology to measure density without touching the substance, eliminating the need for frequent maintenance. Both types of sensors have specific applications based on the nature of the substance being measured and the desired level of accuracy.</p></p>
