<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insect Growth Regulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chitin Synthesis Inhibitors</li><li>Juvenile Hormone Analogs & Mimics</li><li>Anti-juvenile Hormone Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insect Growth Regulator market consists of three main types: Chitin Synthesis Inhibitors, Juvenile Hormone Analogs & Mimics, and Anti-juvenile Hormone Agents. Chitin Synthesis Inhibitors disrupt the formation of insect exoskeletons, leading to growth inhibition. Juvenile Hormone Analogs & Mimics mimic the effects of juvenile hormones, controlling the development and reproduction of insects. Anti-juvenile Hormone Agents block the action of juvenile hormones, preventing insects from molting and growing. These different types of insect growth regulators play a crucial role in pest management and agriculture.</p></p>
