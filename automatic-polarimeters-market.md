<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Polarimeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Temperature Controlled</li><li>Without Temperature Controlled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic polarimeters are devices used to measure the optical rotation of substances in various industries. There are two main types of automatic polarimeters based on temperature control: with temperature control and without temperature control. Polarimeters with temperature control are equipped with a system to maintain a constant temperature throughout the measurement process, ensuring accurate results. On the other hand, polarimeters without temperature control do not have this feature, making them more suitable for applications where temperature fluctuations do not significantly impact the measurement accuracy.</p></p>
