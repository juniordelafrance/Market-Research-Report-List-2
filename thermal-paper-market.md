<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top Coating</li><li>No Top Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal paper with top coating is coated with a special layer that enhances print quality and durability. It is commonly used in applications requiring high quality and long-lasting prints, such as receipts and labels. On the other hand, thermal paper without top coating does not have this additional layer, making it more cost-effective but may result in lower quality prints that fade over time. This type is often used for temporary or less critical applications where print longevity is not a primary concern.</p></p>
