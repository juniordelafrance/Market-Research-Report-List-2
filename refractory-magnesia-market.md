<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Magnesia Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fused Magnesia</li><li>Dead Burned Magnesia</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refractory magnesia is classified into three main types: Fused magnesia, Dead burned magnesia, and Others. Fused magnesia is produced by melting magnesite in an electric arc furnace, resulting in a dense, high purity product suitable for applications requiring high refractoriness. Dead burned magnesia is produced by heating magnesite to high temperatures, creating a product with low reactivity and high resistance to corrosion. The "Others" category includes magnesia products that do not fit into the above two categories, such as caustic calcined magnesia.</p></p>
