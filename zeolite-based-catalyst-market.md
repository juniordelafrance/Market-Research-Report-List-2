<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zeolite-based Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Granules</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zeolite-based catalysts are typically available in two main forms: powder and granules. Powdered zeolite catalysts consist of finely ground particles that are often used in fluidized bed reactors or as additives in various industrial processes. Granular zeolite catalysts, on the other hand, are larger particles that are commonly used in fixed bed reactors due to their greater resistance to pressure and mechanical wear. Both forms of zeolite catalysts offer unique advantages and applications depending on the specific industry and process requirements.</p></p>
