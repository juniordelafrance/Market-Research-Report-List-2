<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethylene Dichloride Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Chlorination</li><li>Oxychlorination</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ethylene Dichloride is produced through two main processes - Direct Chlorination and Oxychlorination. Direct Chlorination involves the reaction of ethylene with chlorine gas at high temperatures, resulting in the production of ethylene dichloride. Oxychlorination, on the other hand, involves the reaction of ethylene with hydrochloric acid and oxygen, also producing ethylene dichloride. Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, with Direct Chlorination being more commonly used due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, while Oxychlorination offers higher selectivity and efficiency.</p></p>
