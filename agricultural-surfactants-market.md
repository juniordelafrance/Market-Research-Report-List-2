<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Surfactants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-ionic</li><li>Anionic</li><li>Cationic</li><li>Amphoteric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural surfactants are categorized into four types based on their ionic charge: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, and amphoteric. Non-ionic surfactants are neutral and do not carry any charge, making them versatile and compatible with a wide range of chemicals. Anionic surfactants have a negative charge, making them effective at dispersing soil particles. Cationic surfactants are positively charged and are often used for controlling pests and weeds. Amphoteric surfactants can carry either a positive or negative charge, providing flexibility in various agricultural applications.</p></p>
