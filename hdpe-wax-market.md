<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Wax Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidation Type HDPE Wax</li><li>Non-oxidation Type HDPE Wax</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE wax is made up of high-density polyethylene, and there are two main types in the market: oxidation type HDPE wax and non-oxidation type HDPE wax. Oxidation type HDPE wax undergoes a process where oxygen molecules interact with the wax, leading to enhanced properties such as increased hardness and improved heat resistance. On the other hand, non-oxidation type HDPE wax does not undergo this process, making it more suitable for applications where its original properties need to be maintained, such as in the production of coatings and adhesives.</p></p>
